# Python wrappers for libigl

A [new and improved version](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/) of the Python bindings is under development.
The new bindings are installed through conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge igl
```

!!! warning
    The `master` branch of the `libigl` repository previously contained **old** Python bindings.
    Those were removed and replaced by new bindings in the latest version of Libigl (v2.2.0).
    Users are encouraged to switch to our conda package to use the new bindings.
    It is a radical change which breaks compatibility between previous versions.
    We plan to stabilize the python bindings by the end of 2020.
